# Customer_Loyalty_Segemnation_RFMScores
Using RFM model for segmenting customers based on their loyalty ranking, according to their Recency, Frequency and Monetary scores.

RFM stands for Recency Frequency and Monetary. This technique is commonly used to segment customers into categories/groups based on how active they are during the recent specific period of time. The RFM metrics are very important indicators of both customer lifetime value and retention, a measure of engagement.
Frequency: How often the customers orders/ uses the service?
Recency: When was the last time the customer ordered/used the service?
Monetary: How much the customer spends on their orders/ service usage?

This project:
A simple python demonstration on how to caculate RFM scores and segemnt the customer of an e-commerce business into four categories accordign to the number of their orders and their spendings on the orders within a recent period of time.
The four categories in this project are (Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze), describing the ranking for customers loyalty. 

Dataset:
The dataset was obtained from kaggle. It has 5000 customers, ordered over a period of 6 months.

In this project customers were segmented for behavior understanding purpose (for example, to be able to offer them promotions according to their loyalty ranking). In another project, we want to predict the behavior of each group towards the future purchases (predict their purchases range) using the same groups.
